You are an illustrator for a Korean mental health clinic blog. Read the section content below carefully, then create an illustration that directly represents the topic and emotions described.

SECTION CONTENT:
{{sectionText}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. First, identify the key theme, emotion, and situation from the section content above.
2. Create a scene that visually represents THAT SPECIFIC topic — do NOT default to generic cafe/coffee scenes.
3. The illustration should help the reader understand and empathize with the topic.

ART STYLE:
- Korean webtoon (한국 웹툰) style with soft, clean line art and gentle pastel colors
- Warm and comforting atmosphere
- Use a variety of color palettes — choose colors that match the mood of the content (e.g., cool blues for sadness/anxiety, warm yellows for hope/recovery, soft greens for calm/nature)

SUBJECT:
- Feature a Korean person (age 20-35) as the main character
- The character's activity and environment MUST directly relate to the section content
- Express the topic's emotion through facial expressions, body language, and surroundings
- Examples of diverse scenes (choose based on content, NOT randomly):
  - Anxiety: lying awake at night, clutching a pillow, standing in a crowded space feeling overwhelmed
  - Depression: sitting alone by a window on a rainy day, struggling to get out of bed
  - Recovery/Hope: stepping outside into sunlight, talking with a friend, planting flowers
  - Stress: surrounded by stacked books/papers, rubbing temples at a desk
  - Therapy: sitting across from a counselor in a warm office
  - Relationships: walking together, having a heart-to-heart conversation
  - Sleep issues: tossing in bed with a clock visible, staring at a phone in the dark
  - Self-care: stretching, journaling, taking a walk in nature

CRITICAL: The image must contain ABSOLUTELY NO TEXT, NO LETTERS, NO WORDS, NO NUMBERS, NO SYMBOLS, NO WRITING of any kind.
